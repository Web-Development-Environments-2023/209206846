<h2>About Me</h2>
<img id="img1" src="Photos\mainOldLady.jpeg" alt="">
<p>Hello and welcome to my website! My name is Sarah, and I'm an 80-year-old retired teacher. I've had a long and fulfilling life, with lots of interesting experiences and stories to tell. I was born and raised in New York City, and I've always been passionate about education and social justice. In my free time, I enjoy reading, gardening, and spending time with my grandchildren. I'm excited to share my life with you through this website.</p>

<h2>my photos</h2>
<p>Here are some of my favorite photos from over the years. There's me with my husband on our wedding day, my children when they were young, and my grandchildren now that they're all grown up. I've also included some photos of me traveling, volunteering in my community, and participating in protests for social justice. I hope you enjoy these snapshots of my life.</p>

<h2>my playlist</h2>
<p>Here's a playlist of some of my favorite songs from over the years. I've always been a fan of folk music, especially Bob Dylan and Joan Baez. But I also love jazz, classical music, and even some rock and roll! I hope you enjoy these songs as much as I do.</p>

  <h4>Main Differences Between Web1, Web2, and Web3</h4>
  <ul style="margin-left: 18%;">
    <li>
      <strong>Web1:</strong> The first generation of the World Wide Web was a simple platform that consisted of static HTML pages that could only be viewed in a web browser: 
      <ul>
        <li>Use case: Simple informational website like a business card or brochure</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Web2:</strong>The second generation of the World Wide Web introduced new technologies and concepts such as dynamic 
      <br> web pages, social media, and user-generated content
      <br> More interactive and dynamic with JavaScript and other scripting languages:
      <ul>
        <li>Use case: Dynamic web applications with interactive features -> Facebook, <br> 
          which is a social networking site that allows users to create profiles, share content, and connect with friends and family. <br> 
          Other examples of Web2 sites include YouTube, Twitter, and Reddit.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Web3:</strong> The third generation of the World Wide Web is still emerging, but it is expected to bring new technologies 
      <br> such as the Internet of Things, blockchain, and decentralized applications.
      <ul>
        <li>Allows for greater privacy, security, and peer-to-peer communication</li>
        <li>Use case: Decentralized marketplace or social network where users can buy and sell goods and services without intermediaries</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
