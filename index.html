<h2>About Me</h2>
<img id="img1" src="Photos\mainOldLady.jpeg" alt="">
<p>Hello and welcome to my website! My name is Sarah, and I'm an 80-year-old retired teacher. I've had a long and fulfilling life, with lots of interesting experiences and stories to tell. I was born and raised in New York City, and I've always been passionate about education and social justice. In my free time, I enjoy reading, gardening, and spending time with my grandchildren. I'm excited to share my life with you through this website.</p>

<h2>my photos</h2>
<p>Here are some of my favorite photos from over the years. There's me with my husband on our wedding day, my children when they were young, and my grandchildren now that they're all grown up. I've also included some photos of me traveling, volunteering in my community, and participating in protests for social justice. I hope you enjoy these snapshots of my life.</p>

<h2>my playlist</h2>
<p>Here's a playlist of some of my favorite songs from over the years. I've always been a fan of folk music, especially Bob Dylan and Joan Baez. But I also love jazz, classical music, and even some rock and roll! I hope you enjoy these songs as much as I do.</p>

<h2>ans</h2>
<p>The main differences between web1, web2, and web3 are:
  Web1 is a static web with basic HTML and CSS, while web2 is more interactive and dynamic with JavaScript, AJAX, and other scripting languages.
  Web3 is the decentralized web with blockchain technology, which allows for greater privacy, security, and peer-to-peer communication.
  A use case for web1 might be a simple informational website like a business card or brochure. A use case for web3 might be a decentralized marketplace or social network where users can buy and sell goods and services without intermediaries.</p>
