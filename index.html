<h2>About Me</h2>

<h2>My photos</h2>
<p>Here are some of my favorite photos from over the years. There's me with my husband on our wedding day, my children when they were young, and my grandchildren now that they're all grown up. I've also included some photos of me traveling, volunteering in my community, and participating in protests for social justice. I hope you enjoy these snapshots of my life.</p>

<h2>My playlist</h2>
<p>Here's a playlist of some of my favorite songs from over the years. I've always been a fan of folk music, especially Bob Dylan and Joan Baez. But I also love jazz, classical music, and even some rock and roll! I hope you enjoy these songs as much as I do.</p>

<div class="differences">
  <p>Main Differences Between Web1, Web2, and Web3</p>
  <br>
  <h2>USE CASE 1: E-commerce website</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Web 1.0: E-commerce websites in the Web 1.0 era were static and one-way. The websites were simple and provided basic information about the products and services. Customers could only browse and purchase products but could not provide feedback or interact with the website.</li>
    <li>Web 2.0: E-commerce websites in the Web 2.0 era became more interactive and customer-oriented. Customers could provide feedback, leave reviews, and interact with other customers through social media integration. E-commerce websites also became more personalized, with product recommendations and targeted advertising based on customers' browsing and purchasing history.</li>
    <li>Web 3.0: In the Web 3.0 era, e-commerce websites will become more intelligent and interconnected, with the use of artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things. Customers will be able to interact with virtual assistants and chatbots, and e-commerce websites will be able to provide more personalized and predictive recommendations based on customers' data and behavior.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>USE CASE 2: Social networking website:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Web 1.0: Social networking websites in the Web 1.0 era were limited to one-way communication. Users could create profiles and share information, but there was no way to interact with other users or create content together.</li>
    <li>Web 2.0: Social networking websites in the Web 2.0 era became more interactive and collaborative. Users could connect with other users, create and share content, and participate in online communities. Social networking websites also became more mobile-friendly, with the rise of smartphones and mobile apps.</li>
    <li>Web 3.0: In the Web 3.0 era, social networking websites will become more decentralized and secure, with the use of blockchain technology. Users will have more control over their data and privacy, and social networking websites will be less reliant on centralized platforms like Facebook and Twitter.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>USE CASE 3: Online education platform:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Web 1.0: Online education platforms in the Web 1.0 era were limited to static content and one-way communication. Students could access course materials and take assessments, but there was no way to interact with instructors or other students.</li>
    <li>Web 2.0: Online education platforms in the Web 2.0 era became more interactive and collaborative. Students could participate in online discussions, collaborate on projects, and receive feedback from instructors and peers. Online education platforms also became more personalized, with adaptive learning algorithms and customized course recommendations.</li>
    <li>Web 3.0: In the Web 3.0 era, online education platforms will become more immersive and intelligent, with the use of virtual and augmented reality. Students will be able to participate in virtual classrooms and simulations, and online education platforms will be able to provide more personalized and adaptive learning experiences based on students' data and behavior.</li>
